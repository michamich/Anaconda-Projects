    "Although the data dump from the Product Hunt API included posts from dates 11-24-2014 to 11-23-2016, one week's worth of the most recent posts (from 11-17-2016 to 11-23-2016) were removed to create **PostsForAnalysis.txt**. This week of posts was removed, because those posts had not been given ample time to receive votes, and thus would have on average fewer votes per post. Since the data contains plenty of posts across the two years, it is okay to remove them. As **PostsForExploration.csv** contains 5,000 randomly-sampled rows from **PostsForAnalysis.txt**, it was also subject to this removal process."
